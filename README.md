This game is open source and free to copy and modify, do keep in mind however that it *is* a fangame of an established property I do not own, so this game is, and will always remain, free. As such, if you make modifications of this game but keep the Broccoli Soup branding, characters, locations, or other such things that belong to the webcomic; it is to be expected that your version is also free of charge.

Also also, the placeholder background music "Evening Dreamcsape pt1 - For Sunset Star Act 1" belongs to the fangame Sonic Before The Sequel, composed by Yuri Matsuura (website dead) and arranged by Falk
