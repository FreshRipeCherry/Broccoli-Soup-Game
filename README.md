This game is open source and free to copy and modify, do keep in mind however that it *is* a fangame of an established property I do not own, so this game is, and will always remain, free. As such, if you make modifications of this game but keep the Broccoli Soup branding, characters, locations, or other such things that belong to the webcomic; it is to be expected that your version is also free of charge.

Also also, the placeholder background music is the White VOID track from the official Broccoli Soup Book 1 Soundtrack
Make sure to check out Pie's bandcamp and toss them some coin for making banging tunes: https://secretpie.bandcamp.com/
