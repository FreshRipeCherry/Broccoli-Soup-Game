This game is open source and free to copy and modify, do keep in mind however that it *is* a fangame of an established property I do not own, so this game is, and will always remain, free.

Also also, the placeholder background music "Evening Dreamcsape pt1 - For Sunset Star Act 1" belongs to the fangame Sonic Before The Sequel, composed by Yuri Matsuura (www.yurimatsuura.com) and arranged by Falk
